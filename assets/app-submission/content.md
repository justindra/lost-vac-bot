Lost in the dark with a dying battery. Navigate procedural mazes, collect power-ups, and find your way home before the lights go out. How far can you go?

## Description

Lost in the dark. Running out of power. Find your way home.

You're a little vacuum bot who's gotten lost in an endless maze. Your battery is draining, and with it, your ability to see. Navigate through the darkness, collect power cells, and find the charging station before you shut down forever.

SIMPLE CONTROLS, INTENSE GAMEPLAY
One-thumb joystick control makes it easy to pick up and play. But as your battery drains, your visible area shrinks — creating genuine tension as you race against time in near-darkness.

ENDLESS PROCEDURAL MAZES
Every level is uniquely generated. No two runs are ever the same. How many mazes can you escape before the darkness catches up?

STRATEGIC SURVIVAL

- Memorize the maze during the brief countdown before fog closes in
- Hunt for battery pickups hidden in dead-ends — but is the detour worth the power cost?
- Clean cells as you move and rack up your score
- Watch your visibility shrink as power fades

FEATURES

- Retro arcade aesthetic with modern polish
- Infinite replayability with procedural generation
- Local high score tracking
- Quick sessions perfect for commutes or breaks
- No ads, no in-app purchases — just pure gameplay

Can you guide your lost bot home?
