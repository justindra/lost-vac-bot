        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Lost Vac Bot ("we", "our", or "the
          App") handles information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> Lost Vac
          Bot is designed with your privacy in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High scores and game progress</li>
          <li>Game settings and preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored on your device and is never transmitted to us or
          any third party. If you uninstall the App, this data will be deleted.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Lost Vac Bot does not use any third-party analytics, advertising
          networks, or tracking services. We do not share any data with third
          parties because we do not collect any data.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Lost Vac Bot does not collect personal information from anyone,

          all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since we do not collect or transmit any personal data, there is no
          risk of your personal information being compromised through our App.
          All game data remains on your device.
        </p>
